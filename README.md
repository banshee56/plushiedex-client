*A PokeDex but for plushies! Here, we can create profiles for plushies and list whether we have "caught" them on the tags or list them as "wanted" if we have not yet.*

## What Worked Well

* redux! Once I figured it out
* framer motion was fun to use for animations 

## What Didn't

* using redux for textboxes, I was dispatching on changes, which meant that my input cursor kept going back to the end of the textbox value
  * but not to worry, I fixed this!

## Extra
* I animated my buttons, icons, and posts using Framer Moton! This includes on-hover and on-tap animations.
* I made the website usable over mobile!
