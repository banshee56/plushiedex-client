# PlushieDex

*A PokeDex but for plushies! Here, we can create profiles for plushies and list whether we have "caught" them on the tags or list them as "wanted" if we have not yet.*

**NOTE: I am using a free 24hr late day**

## What Worked Well

* redux! Once I figured it out 

## What Didn't

## Extra Credit

* I did the suggested animation EC by animting to my buttons, icons, and posts using Framer Moton! This includes on-hover and on-tap animations.
* I also did the suggested "make your own" CRUD-based website; instead of doing a regular blog post, I'm doing a sort of catalgoue for plushies where I display plushie profiles instead of regular blog posts. Tags are used to say if the plushies have been "caught" or not.
