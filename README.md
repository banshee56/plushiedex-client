# PlushieDex

*A PokeDex but for plushies! Here, we can create profiles for plushies and list whether we have "caught" them on the tags or list them as "wanted" if we have not yet.*

## What Worked Well

* redux! Once I figured it out
* framer motion was fun to use for animations 

## What Didn't

* using redux for textboxes, I was dispatching on changes, which meant that my input cursor kept going back to the end of the textbox value
  * but not to worry, I fixed this!

## Extra Credit

Lab4:
* I did the suggested animation EC by animting to my buttons, icons, and posts using Framer Moton! This includes on-hover and on-tap animations.
* I also did the suggested "make your own" CRUD-based website; instead of doing a regular blog post, I'm doing a sort of catalgoue for plushies where I display plushie profiles instead of regular blog posts. Tags are used to say if the plushies have been "caught" or not.
* I made the website usable over mobile! It displays all the pages differently and well for small screens

Lab5:
* I added new fields for gender, height, and weight for the plushies!
