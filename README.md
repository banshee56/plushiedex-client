# Starterpack

Short assignment 2

[deployed url](https://bansharees-starterpack.onrender.com)

## What Worked Well
* the instructions were clear and helpful!

## What Didn't
* error saying `vite-plugin-eslint` doesnâ€™t exist, had to install it using `npm` which I think the instructions missed out on saying

## Extra Credit
* I installed a node version manager, nvm, from the link in the instructions. I attached the screenshot of it in use in the screenshots section (screenshot 1).
